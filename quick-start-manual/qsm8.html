<h3>2.8.1.1. About TRE ALTAMIRAs FM App<a class="headerlink" href="#about-tre-altamiras-fm-app" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>TRE-ALTAMIRAs flood monitoring service allows users to generate water mask, water frequency maps, flood maps, flood frequency maps and produce statistics from a list of SAR images. The service is based on Sentinel 1 SAR acquisitions and ASAR for historical analysis as well as the possibility of results refinement using high resolution Sentinel-2 Optical Data.
The usage of EO data means low costs and low labour intensity, easy mapping of large areas and a high spatial resolution. Furthermore near real-time monitoring is possible using satellites with high temporal resolution and floods in physically inaccessible areas can be easily monitored.</p>

<h4>2.8.1.1.1. Flood Monitoring Application Input<a class="headerlink" href="#flood-monitoring-application-input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As input for the FM application, there is EO data available of multiple satellite sensors with varying spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. For the FM application there is currently data available from Sentinel-1 GRD, Sentinel-2 and Envisat ASA IMP 1P.</p>
<p><strong>Sentinel-1</strong>  High Spatial , High Temporal Resolution</p>
<p>The resolution of Sentinel-1 in ground is approximately 20x5m. TRE ALTAMIRAs FM application uses Ground Range Detected (GRD) images for processing. These images are already pre-processed; they are corrected and prepared in ground range projection. Once projected with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) the images can achieve 10x10 meters, as some data is interpolated below the initial resolution. To ease the processing and the volume of data storage, the spatial resolution of the FM output products is 20x20 meters.
Sentinel-1’s Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-sensor works in the microwave spectrum, specifically in C-band. C band has a wavelength of approximately 5.6 cm and the frequency of the satellites is around 5.405 Ghz. For more info about Sentinel-1, please visit <a class="reference external" href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/resolutions">https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/resolutions</a>. The revisit frequency of Sentinel-1 is, due to ascending and descending and overlap images, approximately 1-3 days depending on the latitude. As such Sentinel-1 has a high temporal resolution.</p>
<p><strong>ENVISAT (ASAR)</strong>      High Spatial , Monthly Temporal Resolution</p>
<p>The specifications of ENVISAT satellite and its data products are comparable to those of Sentinel-1 as it also uses the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR)-sensor. ENVISATs sensor therefore works in the microwave spectrum just like Sentinel-1 SAR-sensor. The FM app product output using ENVISAT-data products is also 20x20 meters. For more specification of ENVISAT ASAR please visit <a class="reference external" href="http://envisat.esa.int/handbooks/asar/toc.html">http://envisat.esa.int/handbooks/asar/toc.html</a>.
The main difference with Sentinel-1 is the considerably lower temporal resolution of ENVISAT with a revisit frequency of approximately 35 days. As such ENVISAT has an average temporal resolution. In the context of HTEP, ENVISAT data products can be used for historical analysis of floods. HTEP ENVISAT data is currently only available from 2003 until 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Sentinel-2</strong>   High Spatial, Weekly Temporal Resolution</p>
<p>Sentinel-2 works not in the microwave spectrum but in the multi-spectrum: the visible spectrum and infrared spectrum. Each band of Sentinel-2 has its own wavelength and frequency, hence the resolution is dependent on the used band also. Some bands have a resolution of 10x10m whereas others have a resolution of 20x20m. The FM application uses 20x20m resolution optical images to refine the results obtained from Sentinel-1 and ENVISAT SAR data products. Sentinel-2 has a monthly revisit of approximately five times, meaning a weekly temporal resolution. For more information about Sentinel-2 please visit <a class="reference external" href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi">https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="influence-of-obstructions-such-as-clouds">
<h5>2.8.1.1.1.1. Influence of obstructions such as clouds<a class="headerlink" href="#influence-of-obstructions-such-as-clouds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As mentioned in Section 2.8.1.1.1, Sentinel-1 and ENVISAT make use of sensors working in the microwave spectrum. Therefore obstructions such as clouds do not affect the SAR images. SAR is optimal for instance in areas with huge cloud coverage (floods in hurricane storms and in wet season in several areas with large amount of rainfall) where the optical sensors are very limited. As such there is no need to take into account obstructions such as cloud coverage when you pick data products for analysis from either Sentinel-1 or ENVISAT.
However, Sentinel-2 data is used to refine the water masks using optical sensors operating in the multispectrum. As those sensors use the backscattering of light within the visible spectrum, wavelengths cannot properly penetrate obstructions such as clouds and haze, meaning those kind of obstructions sometimes result in difficult measuring conditions. The quality of refinement is therefore dependent on the cloud coverage in the Sentinel-2 images.</p>

<h4>2.8.1.1.2. Flood Monitoring Application Output<a class="headerlink" href="#flood-monitoring-application-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Flood Monitoring application currently has an extensive list of possible output results: water masks, reference mask, water frequency map, flood maps, flood frequency map and maximum floodable area. Figure 2 shows the water frequency map of the river between Viet Tri and Hanoi, in the Red River basin. In this tutorial , amongst others those results will be reproduced.</p>

Currently the default map is of Northern Vietnam and Southern China: the Red River basin. The default map shown upon opening the FM app may change in the future.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You can zoom in and zoom out by clicking on the + and – icons on the left side of the Geobrowser, encircled in red. The map can be shifted to any desired area by clicking on the map and dragging your mouse. For this tutorial the focus is kept on default; the Red River area in Northern Vietnam and Southern China.</li>

<li>If you are correctly logged onto the HTEP platform, on the top-right of the Geobrowser your username should be displayed (2a). If you need any further explanation about the HTEP-platform and its features, a Help Guide can be easily accessed by clicking on the book-icon next to the email-icon (2b). If this is insufficient, you can ask for help through the contact form (2c). If you would like to sign out, this can also be done within the Geobrowser by the exit-icon (2d).</li>
<li>You can select which satellite data source you would like to use for your research on the top-right of the Geobrowser. Selecting EO Data imposes a dropdown menu showing all available remotely sensed EO data sources for this application.</li>
</ol>
<p>As discussed in Section 2.8.1.1.1, the FM application has currently data available from Sentinel-1, Envisat, and Sentinel-2. The EO data to be selected depends on your requirements and research purposes, as each satellite has its own specifications suiting different requirements. Sentinel-1 and Envisat have relatively similar specifications and are the main input parameters for analysis: Sentinel-1 for monitoring recent flooding data and Envisat for historical analysis. Sentinel-2 products are optical data products used to refine the analysis of the main input products.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, Sentinel-1 data is selected.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Once EO data from a certain satellite is selected, you can search for specific data images (data products) within the available database from the selected satellite. The options to filter your data products of interest out of the complete database are listed below. The actions can also be combined for an even more specific data search.</li>
</ol>
<div class="img-container-border figure align-center" id="id7">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/qsm6-f7.png"><img alt="../_images/qsm6-f7.png" src="../_images/qsm6-f7.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 7: Step 4,5 - Search for data products in the Geobrowser</span></p>
</div>
<p>➢       Search Field (4a): On the top-left of the Geobrowser, you see a search field. In this field, you can do a text search for specific EO data products within the data source chosen in step 3. For now this field is left blank.</p>
<p>➢       Clicking on the magnifying glass (4b) below the search field, opens the Search Panel of Figure 8a: a panel containing multiple additional filters to find your desired data product. For example the productType and a time range filter. Show Other Parameters opens another extensive list of filters, amongst others track and orbit of the image, cloud- and land cover filters and geometry filters for a spatial search.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 8a: Data products search panel</span></p>
</div>
<p>➢       A big amount of data will originally be shown on the screen and in the list when a polygon is drawn. To limit the amount of images in the search and ease the step of Selecting images, it is recommended to filter the images by the track number. The track is a marker, which is specific of all the images with the same geometry of acquisition, and thus will have a similar footprint, incidence angle and the same pass. The service needs at least two images of the same track to work correctly.Different tracks can be combined, but at least each of the tracks has to contain a pair of acquisitions/dates to produce outputs.</p>
<p>➢       The track number can be obtained by clicking on one of the images on the geobrowser and check the number enclosed in the panel list or in the pop-up window, such as it is highlighted on Figure 8b.</p>

<p>➢       Once the track is obtained, the search can be filtered by this parameter on the &#8220;Show Other parameters&#8221; options (see Figure 8a). Additional parameters and options will be disclosed and the user will be able to introduce the number of track in the tag and applying the search such as it is done in the following example of Figure 8c.</p>

➢       The amount of data will be now reduced to only the overlapping of the track and the AOI drawn. The polygon drawn will be shown in WKT string format on the geometry tag. To remove the track filter option, it can be done by deleting the track number and apply again the search or by cancelling the earth observation tab, highlighted in blue on Figure 8d.</div>

</div>
<p>➢       Although the Search Panel already provides you the option for a spatial filter based search, you can also apply a spatial search through the tools of 4c. A polygon, rectangle, marker and well-known text (WKT) code can be used to define your area of interest. For this tutorial a spatial filter is applied using a WKT-code. Click on the WKT button: the pop-up of Figure 9 appears.</p>
<div class="img-container-border figure align-center" id="id12">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/qsm8-f9.png"><img alt="../_images/qsm8-f9.png" src="../_images/qsm8-f9.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 9: Step 4c - Apply a spatial filter using WKT-code or Shapefile</span></p>
</div>
<p>As you can see a spatial filter can be applied using a WKT-code, but also by simply dragging and dropping a Shapefile or uploading a Shapefile from your computer. For now a WKT-text is used. Copy and paste the following code in the top field: POLYGON((105.437 21.365,105.33 21.326,105.314 21.224,105.407 21.172,105.531 21.115,105.756 21.067,105.807 21.182,105.646 21.238,105.529 21.229,105.437 21.365)) and click on OK. This WKT code is the area of interest, the part of the Red River between Viet Tri and Hanoi: the river should now be boxed by a pink dashed line.</p>
<p>➢       Now also a time filter is applied. The time filter can be applied not only through the Search Panel, but also using the tool of 4d indicated in Figure 7. The slider at the bottom is a time filter that can set by sliding the begin and end date to the desired time range. For now drag the left side of the time filter to 2017-03-01 and the right side of the time filter to 2017-03-31. Alternatively use the Search Panel.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>The current search results, based on the selected satellite and the applied filters, are displayed on the bottom left of the Geobrowser. The data products in this box are also displayed on the map of the Geobrowser by means of orange rectangles. There should be 5 data products found for the search of this tutorial.</li>

Change the satellite data source from Sentinel-1 to Sentinel-2 to see if there are usable optical data products for result refinement. Three data product appear: click on them for additional information. As you can see, all data products have a cloud coverage of &gt;98%. Therefore using Sentinel-2 data for refinement purposes is impossible for this exercise.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>The products in the features basket can be easily selected/deselected and/or removed using the options on the top-right of the features basket.</li>
<li>All data products dropped in the features basket, can together be saved as a single Data Package using the Save button on the top-right of the features basket box.

<p>➢       Satellite constellation: Here you define from which satellite you are going to analyse products. For this tutorial this is Sentinel-1.</p>
<p>➢       Area of interest: Define your area of interest. Click on the arrow next to the input field and a dropdown menu appears.  Pick bbox (bounding box) - geometry to define the area used as a spatial filter in Step 4 of Section 2.8.2.1 as the area of interest. The WKT-code will appear in the field.</p>
<p>➢       Temporal baseline: In this field it should be indicated what maximum time difference is allowed between the input Sentinel-1/ENVISAT data products and the Sentinel-2 data products. If the differences in water bodies between both data products are too large, it is not useful to use one product to refine the results of another product. A suitable baseline depends on the area and the event. The baseline is by default 48 hours, for this tutorial this is left as default.</p>
<p>➢       Reference Type: Select your type of reference. Selecting this field provides you a dropdown list with 3 options: common area in all water masks, reference data selection, water mask with minimum amount of water. For this exercise, select the first option; common area in all water masks.</p>
<p>➢       Reference Date: If you select reference data selection in the previous field, then this field is meant to provide the exact date of reference for the flood monitoring. It means the reference data can be left at NONE for this exercise.</p>
