<p>This guideline provides information about the Water Quality application of the Hydrology Thematic Exploitation Platform (HTEP). Simultaneously this document provides a hands-on tutorial showing you how to produce a water quality map of your area of interest using the application in combination with the various features of HTEP.</p>
<div class="section" id="water-quality-application-an-introduction">
<h2>2.5.1. Water Quality Application: An Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#water-quality-application-an-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is of essential importance to be able to monitor temporal and spatial dynamics of inland water quality in order to obtain improved understanding of aquatic ecosystems. Making use of remotely sensed earth observation (EO) data is an efficient and cost-effective method to assess a variety of physical and biological parameters in aquatic ecosystems over large areas. The thematic application Water Quality (WQ), developed by EOMAP, is able to map these aquatic ecosystems. Combining this application with the features of the Hydrology Thematic Exploitation Platform (HTEP) ensures EO data can be easily accessed, processed, reproduced and shared with the hydrology community. In this tutorial the functionalities and features of HTEP using EOMAPs WQ application are discovered.
Chapter 2.5.1.1 discusses important information about the WQ application: the advantages of using EO data over conventional measurement methods and the currently available in- and outputs for the application. The introduction is followed by a hands-on tutorial in Chapter 2.5.2, showing you how to use this application in combination with HTEP.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-eomaps-water-quality-app">
<h3>2.5.1.1. About EOMAPs Water Quality App<a class="headerlink" href="#about-eomaps-water-quality-app" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>EO satellite data for monitoring of water quality yields a wide variety of advantages compared to conventional in-situ measurements. The usage of EO data means low costs and low labour intensity, easy mapping of large areas and a high spatial resolution in contrary to conventional in-situ measurements. Furthermore near real-time monitoring is possible using satellites with high temporal resolution and physically inaccessible areas can be covered. Besides the accuracies are high, typically only 20-30% deviation from in-situ measurements.</p>

<div class="section" id="water-quality-application-input">
<h4>2.5.1.1.1. Water Quality Application Input<a class="headerlink" href="#water-quality-application-input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As input for the WQ application, there is EO data available of multiple satellite sensors, with varying spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. For the WQ application there is currently Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 EO data available:</p>
<p><strong>Sentinel-2</strong>   High Spatial, Weekly Temporal Resolution</p>
<p>The maximum spatial resolution of the output products of the WQ application is approximately 30 meters using Sentinel-2 data[1]. Sentinel-2 has a monthly revisit of approximately 5 times, meaning a weekly temporal resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Landsat-8</strong>    High Spatial, Weekly Temporal Resolution</p>
<p>Landsat-8 has a maximal spatial resolution of about 30 meters, equal to Sentinel-2 data products. The temporal resolution of Landsat-8 is 16 days[1]. Therefore both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data products are ideal for large scale monitoring of most relevant lake and river sizes.
The spectral bands of Sentinel-2’s sensors range between 490 and 1375 nm and Landsat-8’s sensors range between 433 and 2300 nm[3] [4]. However, the output parameters of EOMAPs WQ app are based on backscattering of light between 400-850 nm, in the visible spectrum.</p>
<div class="section" id="influence-of-obstructions-such-as-clouds-on-the-results">
<h5>2.5.1.1.1.1. Influence of obstructions such as clouds on the results<a class="headerlink" href="#influence-of-obstructions-such-as-clouds-on-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Multiple considerations are needed to decide what data products are usable for the WQ app. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, output parameters of the WQ app are determined based on backscattering of light within the visible spectrum. Wavelengths in the visible spectrum cannot properly penetrate obstructions such as clouds and haze, meaning those kind of obstructions sometimes result in difficult measuring conditions. In addition, particular geometrical conditions between sun, target and sensor in combination with specific sea-state-conditions (wind speed, direction) can result in signal distorting mirroring effects, called sun glint, on the water surface. Other circumstances influencing the results include cloud shadows, shallow waters, disturbances by floating materials and mixed land-water pixels.
Those pixels are flagged in the results, as will be discussed in Section 2.5.2.5. However, as clear as possible data images contribute to more reliable results. As such special care is required in terms of cloud coverage and sun glint. There are no guidelines for allowed cloud cover percentage, but a reduction in cloud coverage will improve the quality of the output products.</p>

<h4>2.5.1.1.2. Water Quality Application Output<a class="headerlink" href="#water-quality-application-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The output products the WQ app is able to generate are the following four main water quality parameters and an atmospheric correction:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>TSS</strong>  Total Suspended Solids</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The total suspended solid is the dry-weight of scattered particles in the water column. The influence of TSS on aquatic ecology is for example the negative effects on plants and animals due to a reduction of available light.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>CHL</strong>  Chlorophyll</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A pigment included in phytoplankton cells that serves as a proxy for algae in natural waters. The amount of chlorophyll is a measure for water quality, as it relates to algae biomass which can for instance result in decreased levels of dissolved oxygen.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>CDOM</strong>  Colored Dissolved Organic Matter</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>CDOM absorbs light at the blue end of the visible spectrum, therefore being responsible for the water colour. Increasing CDOM, primarily caused by tannin due to decaying detritus, causes the water colour to go from blue, green to brown. The amount of CDOM importantly affects aqua systems: an overdose of CDOM may for instance result in a lack of available light for phytoplankton populations to grow, while phytoplankton is the basic of oceanic food chains and important for atmospheric oxygen.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>SWT</strong>  Surface Water Temperature</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>SWT speaks for itself, as it means the WQ app is able to determine the temperature at the surface of a water body at the top skin, also known as the epilimnic temperature. Water surface temperature knowledge is important in aquatic ecosystems to better determine and predict for instance wind streams introduced by temperature differences.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Atmospheric corrected product</strong></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Consists of satellite imagery which has been corrected for the effects of the atmosphere and scattering light from adjacent land and water surfaces. It provides reflectance data instead of scaled radiances or top-of-the atmosphere products and improves satellite imagery by minimizing effects of haze and atmospheric aerosols.</p>

<p>Once the Water Quality application has been accessed, a new tab opens called the Geobrowser. This part of the tutorial will teach you to work with the various features and functions available within the Geobrowser. Currently the default map is of Northern Vietnam and Southern China: the Red River basin. The default map shown upon opening the WQ app may change in the future.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You can zoom in and zoom out by clicking on the + and – icons on the left side of the Geobrowser, encircled in red. The map can be shifted to any desired area by clicking on the map and dragging your mouse. For this tutorial the focus is kept on default; the Red River area in Northern Vietnam and Southern China.</li>
</ol>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 7: Step 1,2 and 3 - The water quality application Geobrowser</span></p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>If you are correctly logged onto the HTEP platform, on the top-right of the Geobrowser your username should be displayed (2a). If you need any further explanation about the HTEP-platform and its features, a Help Guide can be easily accessed through clicking on the book-icon next to the email-icon (2b). If this is insufficient, you can ask for help through the contact form (2c). If you would like to sign out, this can also be done within the Geobrowser by the exit-icon (2d).</li>
<li>You can select which satellite data source you would like to use for your research on the top-right of the Geobrowser. Selecting EO Data imposes a dropdown menu showing all available remotely sensed EO data sources for this application.</li>
</ol>
<p>As discussed in Section 2.5.1.1.1, the WQ application has currently data available from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The EO data to be selected depends on your requirements and research purposes, as each satellite has its own specifications suiting different requirements. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 have relatively similar specifications. They both have for example a rather high spatial resolution of 30m, meaning they are well suited for monitoring of water quality in rivers and small lakes.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, Landsat-8 data is selected.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Once EO data from a certain satellite is selected, you can search for specific data images (data products) within the available database from the selected satellite. The options to filter your data products of interest out of the complete database are listed below. The actions can also be combined for an even more specific data search.</li>
</ol>
<div class="img-container-border figure align-center" id="id8">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/qsm5-f8.png"><img alt="../_images/qsm5-f8.png" src="../_images/qsm5-f8.png" style="width: 60%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 8: Step 4,5 - Search for data products in the geobrowser</span></p>
</div>
<p>➢       Search Field (4a): On the top-left of the Geobrowser, you see a search field. In this field, you can do a text search for specific EO data products within the data source chosen in step 3. For now this field is left blank.</p>
<p>➢       Clicking on the magnifying glass (4b) below the search field, opens the Search Panel of Figure 9: a panel containing multiple additional filters to find your desired data product. For example the productType and a time range filter. Show Other Parameters opens another extensive list of filters, amongst others cloud- and land cover filters and geometry filters for a spatial search. For now also leave the Search Panel untouched, so at default settings.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The Search Field cannot be used to search for geographic places: this feature in non-existent in the Geobrowser.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 9: Data products search panel</span></p>
</div>
<p>➢       Although the Search Panel already provides you the option for a spatial filter based search, you can also apply a spatial search through the tools of 4c. A polygon, rectangle, marker and well-known text (WKT) code can be used to define your area of interest. For this tutorial a spatial filter is applied using a WKT-code. Click on the WKT button: the pop-up of Figure 10 appears.</p>
<div class="img-container-border figure align-center" id="id10">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/qsm5-f10.png"><img alt="../_images/qsm5-f10.png" src="../_images/qsm5-f10.png" style="width: 60%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 10: Step 4c - Apply a spatial filter using WKT-code or Shapefile</span></p>
</div>
<p>As you can see a spatial filter can be applied using a WKT-code, but also by simply dragging and dropping a Shapefile or uploading a Shapefile from your computer. For now a WKT-text is used. Copy and paste the following code in the top field: POLYGON((104.86 22.1,105.006 21.951,105.072 21.731,105.057 21.678,104.951 21.714,104.826 21.87,104.709 22.045,104.86 22.1)) and click on OK. This WKT code is the Yen Binh water reservoir: the reservoir should now be boxed by a pink dashed line.</p>
<p>➢       Now also a time filter is applied. The time filter can be applied not only through the Search Panel, but also using the tool of 4d indicated in Figure 8. The slider at the bottom is a time filter that can set by sliding the begin and end date to the desired time range. For now drag the left side of the time filter to 2017-01-01 and leave the right side of the time filter at default: 2017-05-01.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>The current search results, based on the selected satellite and the applied filters, are displayed on the bottom left of the Geobrowser. The data products in this box are also displayed on the map of the Geobrowser by means of orange rectangles. There should be 7 data products found for the search of this tutorial.</li>
<li>If you would like to share your search results, click on the blue icon above the search results. The link can be copied and pasted or be posted through social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter). Feel free to share if you like.</li>
