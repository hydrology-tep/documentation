Water Quality
=============

Water Quality parameters Chlorophyll, Total Suspended Solids and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter based on Organic Absorption will be provided by EOMAPs proprietary water quality processor Modular Inversion and Processing System (MIP). The processors include sensor independent state-of-the-art algorithms including adjacency correction, coupled atmospheric-in-water retrieval considering all bi-directional aspects from extreme clean to extreme turbid case 2 waters in a physically correct approach.

Access to the thematic application
----------------------------------

From the thematic application page, click on the **Open App** button for the **Water Quality** application.

A new page with the geobrowser, data collections and processing services associated to the Water Quality application will appear.

|
Open the 'Processing Services' section by clicking on **Processing Services** on the right-hand side of the geobrowser window:

Select what kind of **EO Data** data you would like to process using the dropdown menu on the top right, so far Water Quality Service only supports Landsat8 and Sentinel2.

Zoom to your region of interest and use the **spatial filter** to spatially restrict the list of scenes: Click on the spatial filter symbol (little square) on the left-hand side of the geobrowser and draw a rectangle on the map.

Use the **temporal filter** via the time slider at the bottom of the map to restrict the list of scenes temporally:

|
The list of available scenes is now filtered for your needs. If you identified a scene you would like to process you can add the scene via drag&drop from the scene list on the bottom left to the Water Quality Service:

.. figure:: ../includes/apps_wq_selectdata.png
	:figclass: img-border
	:align: center
	:width: 100%

|
Select **one** of the three available **processing options**:

	:scale: 90%

|
Select a **title** for your processing job, e.g. "My first Water Quality Job for Bamako" 

.. figure:: ../includes/apps_wq_jobtitle.png
	:figclass: img-border
	:align: center
	:scale: 90%

|
Now you can **either** click on the **Run Job** button

.. figure:: ../includes/apps_wq_runjob0.png
	:figclass: img-border
	:align: center
	:scale: 150%

|
**OR** you could add more scenes to your job, from the same EO Data collection or you can even add scenes from another collection.
Therefore just change the **EO Data** collection in the dropdown menu on the top right:

.. figure:: ../includes/apps_wq_eodata2.png
	:figclass: img-border
	:align: center
	:scale: 90%

|
Your selected **spatial and temporal filters remain** and you can look for a scene from the other collection. 
If you identified another scene you would like to process can add the scene via drag&drop from the scene list on the bottom left to the Water Quality Service:

.. figure:: ../includes/apps_wq_selectdata2.png
	:figclass: img-border
	:align: center
	:width: 100%

|
If your are satisfied with your scenes and settings click on the **Run Job** button to start the processing.
