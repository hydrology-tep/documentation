Catalogue editor
================

The catalogue editor area is a workspace dedicated to the user in which he will be able to access all his files (results of processings, uploaded files, ...), manage them and specially ingest them in one of his catalogus or ask to publish the result as a contribution to the community results (this would need to be validated by an administrator).
