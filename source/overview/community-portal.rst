Services data sets
------------------

Hydrology TEP core users define all external data sets needed by their own services (see H-TEP System & ServicesTechnical Note issue 1.4, chapter 5.1.3). These data sets include DEM, land cover, soil moisture, precipitation and evapotranspiration data. These data sets will be made available through the H-TEP web portal if there are no restrictions for their public dissemination. Other external data sets might be available through dedicated user request after H-TEP Consortium analysis.
