Become Member of a Community
----------------------------
  	
Within the HTEP Community, you can become a member of your own community: A group of HTEP users who share a similar interest, for instance the same geographical area, the same organization/institution or the same research area (e.g. flooding, water quality, etc). This document shows you how to join a community and guides you through the community webpage(s). 

..NOTE:: 
	Some of the functions and features below are not visible if you are not registered and logged onto HTEP. Also, some features and functions might be invisible because your user status has not increased from ‘starter’ to ‘explorer’ yet.
