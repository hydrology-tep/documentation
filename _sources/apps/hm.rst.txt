Hydrological Modelling
======================

Hydrological modelling service providing data on river discharge, lake outflow, water level in lakes and rivers, as well as land surface water balance components (precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture) within the area covered by the model domain. Assimilation of earth observation data from the other TEP Hydrology processing services is a core feature of the service. The service will provide data from simulation of historical periods, short-term and seasonal forecast, as well as climate change scenarios.
